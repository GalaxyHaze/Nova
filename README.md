# Kalidous Language

> **WIP:** Kalidous is currently in active development. While the core concepts are being defined, the project is not yet stable or ready for production use.

## About

Kalidous is a general-purpose programming language designed to bridge the gap between high-level developer ergonomics and low-level system performance.

It compiles directly to LLVM IR, leveraging one of the most powerful and battle-tested compiler infrastructures in the world — the same backend used by languages like Clang, Rust, and Swift — while offering a modern, distinct syntax and feature set tailored for safety and speed.

## Current Status

We are currently in the early stages of development. Here is a snapshot of the project's progress:

### Completed
- **File Handling:** Reliable source code ingestion and file management.
- **Tokenizer:** A fully functional lexical analyzer that breaks source code into tokens for processing.

### In Progress
- **CLI Interface:** Currently building out the command-line interface to handle file execution, compilation, and project initialization.

### Roadmap
- Parser & AST construction
- LLVM IR code generation
- Standard Library foundations

## Design Philosophy

Kalidous is not just "Zig with different syntax." It aims to inherit the raw power of Zig while introducing new capabilities that make the compiler and the programmer work as a team.

### 1. Direct LLVM Backend
By compiling directly to LLVM IR, Kalidous gains access to world-class optimizations, broad platform support, and the same infrastructure trusted by Clang, Rust, and Swift. This allows us to focus on language design while LLVM handles optimal machine code generation across all major architectures.

### 2. Compilation Capabilities
One of the core goals of Kalidous is to unlock deep compile-time capabilities. We intend to provide features where the programmer and the compiler communicate effectively, allowing for highly optimized code generation and advanced reflection techniques that feel natural rather than hacky.

### 3. Safety & Memory Management
Performance should not come at the cost of safety. Kalidous is designed with a memory management model that prioritizes both **Safety** (preventing common vulnerabilities) and **Speed** (minimal runtime overhead), ensuring developers can write fast code without fear of memory corruption.
